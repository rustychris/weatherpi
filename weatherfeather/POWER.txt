Modules:
  PMS5003 particulate sensor:
   power 5V, logic is 3.3V
   serial (at least TX pin from particle sensor to rx on feather)
   active current <= 100mA
   connect to USB, which provides the 5V power.  this also means that
   it can't run off battery power, only USB.
   

  bme280 pressure
   i2c or spi
   power with 3.3V
   current during all measurements below 1mA.

  light sensor: 0.4mA while sensing
   i2c:
   power with 3.3V to match logic


So the PMS5003 gets 5V power, and draws up to 100mA
everybody else gets 3.3V power, with negligible draw.

The feather itself, with wifi on, can draw up to 140mA,
commonly 100mA.
